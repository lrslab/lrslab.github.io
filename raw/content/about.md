### Our group's current research interest:
1. Developing applications/pipelines to accommodate the Nanopore DNA/RNA sequencing platform. 
2. Developing toolkits for genome assembly, scaffolding, finishing, improvement and comparative analysis. 
3. Studying the nucleotide modifications (like m6A) in RNAs (including viral/prokaryotic/eukaryotic RNAs). 
4. Mechanism of hybrid incompatibilities between _Canorhabditis briggsae_ and _nigoni_.  
5. DNA modifications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 

### Open positions:
- Research student (PhD) position on bioinformatics.
- Research student (PhD) position on Canorhabditis based genetic research. 

### We have both wet-lab and dry-lab parts:
##### Wet-lab:
-   Sequencers: Nanopore Sequencing machines (MinION and PromethION P2) :
